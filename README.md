# Sports Data Analysis Project

Contributors: Ben Gunnels, Tim Schneider

## Project Goal

This project will be directed at analyzing live and historical sports performance by gathering different sources of data, exploring unique data hypotheses, providing projection and forecasting, and analyzing player value for a range of sports. The initial stage of the project will focus on publicly available NFL data for fantasy performance projection and ex post facto analysis. In the future the methods produced will be applied to other sports for similar analysis. The results and conclusions of the analysis will be shared via an X (Twitter) account both manually and automatically via API when necessary.
